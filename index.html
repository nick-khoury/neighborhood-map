	<!-- "HTML is loaded by the browser in the order it appears in the file. If the JavaScript is loaded first and it is supposed to affect the HTML below it, it might not work, as the JavaScript would be loaded before the HTML it is supposed to work on. Therefore, putting JavaScript near the bottom of the HTML page is often the best strategy."

So, you can imagine if you have plenty of <script> tags in the head, calling on multiple external scripts will block the HTML from loading, thus greeting the user with a blank white screen, because no other content on your page will load until the JS files have completely loaded."

	jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
	Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
	about what is actually visible on a website.

	While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
	DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
	its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
	object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
	website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
	the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
	you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
